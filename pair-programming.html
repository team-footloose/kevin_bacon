     * Make a function named isNumeric(input) that returns if the input is a number like 5 or 2.3 or a string containing only a number like "2". Example isNumeric(3) is - true. isNumeric("banana") should return false.
     Make a function named isEqual(input1, input2) that returns if both inputs have the same value. areEqual
     Make a function named isIdentical(input1, input2) that returns if both inputs are same value and data type.
     Make a function named not(input) returns the input with a flipped boolean
     Make a function named isOdd(number) that returns true if the number is odd
     Make a function named isEven(number) that returns true if the number is even or zero
     Make a function named isPositive(number) that returns true if the provided input is a positive number. False for zero or any other number or data type.
     Make a function named isNegative(number) that returns true if the provided input is a negative number. False for zero or any other number or data type.
