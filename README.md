Round One - Pods - Labs Edition 



## This is the start of a great beginning within the Ceres cohort. The lands traveled in the mindmaps of you and your comrads in Futureville, North America (and beyond) will (most likely) start here (unless you're already Ultimate Warrior Champion status)! Also if you haven't, do it. Tell yourself how awesome you are for joining Pods - Lab Edition. If you don't want do, seek help within this pod or the others and the echo of awesomeness can and will make you come to. 
## To your newly discovered awesomeness!!!!!!!
## We are the film Footloose starring Kevin Bacon in team form!
## Together, we triumph throught the exercise waters of past rash, not leaving a permanent scar on our personal domain servers, yet pushing through the brain pain of forgetting why we're here and legalizing study habits in our form law once again!!!
## Let's ammend these docs together ( e.g.  this.function_-kevin_bacon-.md     <<<< find dat error!!  )
## We will cross the finish as a team! And a big win individually!
## Let's make jerseys?
## Jokes to the former... ( or were they?? How committed is too commited?  -Questions to check yourself with ) 
## This is the best day you've ever had!
## You are still reading this markdown so your day is already getting better!
## Teamwork in the dream, works!


## One life to love!
